# TeX 2 JATS XML for Seismica

# Introduction
There are two options to run the scripts. There's a docker-based setup that only requires installation of Docker and automatically manages all other dependencies. The other option is to install the dependencies and run the shell script that calls the python files to perform the conversions.

Follow the steps in the following order - 
1. [SCE Requirements](#sce-requirements)
1. [Base Requirements](#base-requirements)
1. Workflow [Docker Option](#workflow-option-1---using-docker) or [Dependencies Option](#workflow-option-2---installing-dependencies)
1. [Post Conversion](#post-conversion)

## SCE Requirements
Before running the TeX2JATS converter, you need to have produced:
- final .tex galleys (proof accepted by authors)
- corrected list of references
- have the final metadata on hand (you can replace it in the JATS galley)
- check that the dates format is correct (Month dd, YYYY)

## Base Requirements
1. Clone the github repo to your local machine. `cd` into the desired directory and clone using - 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/WeAreSeismica/tex2jats.git
    ```

## Workflow Option 1 - Using Docker
1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) if you don't have it already.

1. Start up Docker. Usually you will have an application called "Docker" on your computer with a rudimentary graphical user interface (GUI). You can also run this command in the command-line interface (CLI):
    ```
    open -a Docker
    ```

1. Move the directory containing latex files to be converted into the git repo `tex2jats`.

1. Open the file `env.set`, and edit the parameters in the file as mentioned there. Spaces in names are accepted.

1. Open a shell and navigate to the wherever the git repo is cloned, which now includes the latex files directory.
    ```
    cd path/to/git/repo/tex2jats
    ```
    You can always run `pwd` to check whether you're in the right place.

1. Run docker-compose by entering the below commands in your favorite shell.
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

1. This should convert and create all the necessary files. Conversion may take up to a minute. You can check the status of the conversion by using - 
    ```
    docker-compose logs
    ```
    Verify that there are `xml` files in the latex files directory. 

1. Shut down docker-compose by entering - 
    ```
    docker-compose down
    ```

## Workflow Option 2 - Installing Dependencies

### Dependencies
These ones are shared dependencies with the [docx/odt parsing for Seismica module](https://github.com/WeAreSeismica/seismica-sce):
- python 3.n (preferably 3.8+)
- numpy
- pandoc

Other dependencies:
- python3 datetime (often already installed)
- GNU sed, v4.8
- perl, v>5 (below not tested)

### Option 2 Instructions
1. Copy tex2xml.sh, apa.csl, cleanidjats.py and metatex2jats.py to your current working directory (CWD, where the TeX galley is):  
`cd /cwd/`  
`cp /path/to/tex2jats/tex2xml.sh ./`  
`cp /path/to/tex2jats/*.py ./`  
`cp  /path/to/tex2jats/apa.csl ./`  

1. In your CWD, use tex2xml.sh to convert the TeX to JATS XML:  
`./tex2xml.sh proof biblio`  
with:  
    - `proof`, the name of the TeX galley without the extension (which should be .tex)
    - `biblio`, the name of the corrected list of references, without the extension (which should be .bib)

## Post Conversion
1. Either of the workflows above will output the following files within the latex directory:
    - `proof.xml`  
    - `proof_metadata.jats`  
    - `proof_credits.jats`
    - `proof_galley.xml`
    - `proof_tab1.tex` if you have one table (see point (5)), and one similar file per table
    - `proof_tab1.xml`  
You will then work with the XML galley only (`proof_galley.xml`). Other files are only here for correction if needed.

1. How to view the XML galley? To my knowledge, there is no open-source and easy-to-use tool, so the best way is to open it with a text editor. You will be able to view the galley before publishing on OJS. If you open it with a web browser, it **should not show any error**. You can use the web browser to debug (will show the line of every error).

1. If there are **TABLES** in your TeX galley, tex2xml.sh will export two files for each table: tabxx.tex and tabxx.xml, xx ranging from 1 to the total number of arrays present in the article.  
**If there are equations or math expressions in your table, tex2xml *might* not behave correctly. I would suggest removing them before running the script.**
For each table:  
    1.  Correct any unwanted symbol in `tabxx.tex`
    1.  Translate the `tabxx.tex` to HTML with https://tableconvert.com/latex-to-html
    1.  Copy the HTML code  in the XML table file `tabxx.xml`, where indicated
    4.  Replace the wrong table code in the XML galley `proof_galley.xml` with the updated `tabxx.xml`. In the XML galley, tables are under a `boxed-text` environnement.

1. Proofread XML galley and add metadata if necessary. Some things to check by visual inspection of the XML galley:
    - Metadata, author names, credits, affiliations are here
    - Abstracts are here
    - Reference list is here
    - Every figure is here 

1. Convert every figure to PNG format if not already done. You can use the following bash command (converts every PDF file which starts with fig to a PNG format, requires imagemagick, you can adjust density if needed):  
`mogrify -verbose -quality 00 -density 250  -format png ./fig*.pdf`

1. *Optional*. Check your galley on the Seismica test website. No need to upload the figures. If you can open the XML galley with a web browser without errors, it will load fine in OJS.   

1. Upload the galley PDF and XML files to the OJS website. 
    - For the XML galley, images need to be uploaded separately (no need to fill in the caption etc.)
    - Don't forget the uploading order:
        1) PDF galley
        2) XML galley
        3) Supplementary Materials (any)
        4) Review reports

# TO DO
- Don't use regex, because it is unstable with XML? Oopsâ€¦
- Correctly parse math expressions within tables
